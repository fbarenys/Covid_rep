","A lineage predominantly circulating in New York but with a few exports to other countries. Characterised by spike mutations T95I and D253G, plus others. The most frequent spike mutation pattern is L5F T95I D253G E484K D614G A701V, with a smaller fraction having S477N instead of E484K. Spike mutation E484K is present in about half of this lineage (as of 2021-02-10) - Very possible not all new additions carry T95I and D253G (someone should check this, e.g. for USA/NY-Wadsworth-21008455-01/2021 and Aruba/AW-RIVM-11403/2021)","
